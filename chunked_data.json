Numerous\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.

We varied the learning\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\nlrate = d−0.5\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\n5.4 Regularization\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\n7",

These\nanswer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer\nannotations are used to ﬁnd matches within documents when preparing training data. For RAG, we\nalso make use of multiple annotation examples for Natural Questions and WebQuestions by training\nthe model with each (q,a) pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. For TriviaQA,\nthere are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets,\nsuch as emoji or spelling variants.

    "text": "1 Introduction\nRecent years have featured a trend towards pre-trained language representations in NLP systems, applied in increasingly\nﬂexible and task-agnostic ways for downstream transfer. First, single-layer representations were learned using word\nvectors [MCCD13, PSM14] and fed to task-speciﬁc architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations\nand contextual state were used to form stronger representations [DL15, MBXS17, PNZtY18] (though still applied to\ntask-speciﬁc architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [VSP+17] have\nbeen directly ﬁne-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-speciﬁc architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18].\nThis last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension,\nquestion answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures",

However, a major limitation to this approach is that while\nthe architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-speciﬁc datasets and task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning: to achieve\nstrong performance on a desired task typically requires ﬁne-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands\nof examples speciﬁc to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.\nFirst, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the\napplicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing\nanything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an abstract concept, to critiquing a short story.

For many\nof these tasks it is difﬁcult to collect a large supervised training dataset, especially when the process must be repeated\nfor every new task.\nSecond, the potential to exploit spurious correlations in training data fundamentally grows with the expressiveness\nof the model and the narrowness of the training distribution. This can create problems for the pre-training plus\nﬁne-tuning paradigm, where models are designed to be large to absorb information during pre-training, but are then\nﬁne-tuned on very narrow task distributions. For instance [ HLW+20] observe that larger models do not necessarily\ngeneralize better out-of-distribution. There is evidence that suggests that the generalization achieved under this paradigm\ncan be poor because the model is overly speciﬁc to the training distribution and does not generalize well outside it",

We typically present the model with a few dozen examples in the few shot setting. Exact phrasings for all task\ndescriptions, examples and prompts can be found in Appendix G.\n• Zero-Shot (0S) is the same as one-shot except that no demonstrations are allowed, and the model is only given\na natural language instruction describing the task.

We measure the gradient noise scale during training and use it to guide our choice of batch size [MKAT18]. Table\n2.1 shows the parameter settings we used. To train the larger models without running out of memory, we use a mixture\nof model parallelism within each matrix multiply and model parallelism across the layers of the network.

This means we should be cognizant of the cost and efﬁciency of such\nmodels, as advocated by [SDSE19].\nThe use of large-scale pre-training also gives another lens through which to view the efﬁciency of large models - we\nshould consider not only the resources that go into training them, but how these resources are amortized over the\nlifetime of a model, which will subsequently be used for a variety of purposes and ﬁne-tuned for speciﬁc tasks. Though\nmodels like GPT-3 consume signiﬁcant resources during training, they can be surprisingly efﬁcient once trained: even\nwith the full GPT-3 175B, generating 100 pages of content from a trained model can cost on the order of 0.4 kW-hr, or",
